# Recreational_mathematics
A collection of scripts and notebooks where I tinker with fun mathematical concepts and algorithms.

Most - if not all - of the material here is for fun and should not be taken as mathematical  proof
without completing your own investigations. That said, I hope you find something that peaks your
interest!

This repo is, in part, inspired by the collection of notebooks from Peter Norvig found [here](http://norvig.com/ipython/README.html).
A central index - along with a script that generates the README which is rather fun - can be found [here](http://norvig.com/ipython/).
